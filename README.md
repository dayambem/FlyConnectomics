# FlyConnectomics
FlyConnectomics finds Drosophila neural circuits using network science and graph theory. It calculates path inefficiency to predict connectivity strength, identifying key neurons in motor control and behavior. Features include shortest path analysis, hierarchical visualization, and synaptic weight mapping to uncover functional neural pathways. ðŸš€
